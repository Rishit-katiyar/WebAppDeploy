# 🚀 Super Advanced Infrastructure Setup with Pulumi 🛠️

Welcome to the Super Advanced Infrastructure Setup repository! This project contains an ultra-complex Infrastructure as Code (IaC) setup using Pulumi for deploying a highly scalable and resilient web application infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

## Features 🌟

- **Modular Design**: Components such as VPC, subnets, security groups, EC2 instances, load balancers, CI/CD pipeline, monitoring, and notifications are modularized into separate Pulumi components.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Custom options and configurations are passed to each component as input variables, enabling flexible and dynamic infrastructure provisioning.
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling groups are used to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on demand, ensuring optimal resource utilization and performance.
- **High Availability**: Resources are distributed across multiple availability zones for fault tolerance and high availability.
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: CloudWatch alarms are set up to monitor key metrics such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and request latency, enabling proactive monitoring and alerting.
- **Automation**: Lambda functions are utilized for custom automation tasks, enhancing operational efficiency and reducing manual intervention.
- **Continuous Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline is implemented using AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy for automating the deployment process, ensuring consistent and reliable application updates.

## Introduction 📜

This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for deploying a modern web application infrastructure on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. By leveraging Pulumi, an infrastructure as code tool, we can define and manage our AWS resources in a programmatic and reproducible manner.

## Getting Started 🚦

To get started with deploying the super advanced infrastructure setup with Pulumi, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites 📋

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/) installed on your local machine.
- AWS credentials with appropriate permissions configured on your system.

### Installation 🔧

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rishit-katiyar/WebAppDeploy.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   Navigate to the project directory using the following command:

   ```bash
   cd WebAppDeploy
   ```

3. **Initialize Pulumi Stack**:
   Initialize the Pulumi stack by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pulumi stack init
   ```

4. **Customize the Configuration**:
   Customize the Pulumi variables in each component according to your requirements.

5. **Preview Changes**:
   Preview the changes to be applied using the following command:

   ```bash
   pulumi preview
   ```

6. **Apply Changes**:
   Apply the changes to provision the infrastructure using the following command:
